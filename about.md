About Rishi

Hi, congrats on finding this hidden page. My name is Rishi Gupta and I am a second year student who thinks coding can be fun sometimes. It's painful all of the time. Does that mean that coding is sometimes painful in a fun way? Maybe. Does that help heal the scars that coding has given me? Not a chance.
