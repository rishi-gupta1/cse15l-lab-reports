First, let us take a look at the change directory command.

Psst. Why are wine experts called sommeliers? Because they suh-mell-uh-the-air

1. ![Image](lab1A.png)
   Here, we used the cd command with no arguments. This resulted in us leaving the directory.  
2. ![Image](lab1B.png)
  Here we used the cd command with a path to a directory. This resulted in us entering that directory. 
3. ![Image](lab1C.png)
   Here, we used the cd command with a path to file. This was not very smart of us since the cd feels about paths to files the same way i feel about midterms(not good). Thus, it resulted in an error.

Now let's move onto the ls command(I always read this as 1s).
1. ![Image](lab1D.png)
  I was using "Here" too much, so in this image we have ls with no argument. This resulted in the terminal returning a list of available directories.
2. ![Image](lab1E.png)
   In this image, we used the ls command with an argument passed.
